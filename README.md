## About Dataset

# This dataset contains Japanese Prime Minister Tweet. Japanese culture, diplomatic problem ( North Korea and Tramp etc), time of disaster, economics…

# For example,14.April 2014 "Removing radiation contaminated water in all weather, 365/24 at Fukushima. I am deeply thankful for dedication and commitment of our peers." Maybe if you analyze his tweets about Japanese economy this data will be useful for stock price forecasting etc.
